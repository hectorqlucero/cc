This is a clojure full stack application which includes:
* Clojure
* Compojure
* Ring
* Session Management
* Database MySQL
* Bootstrap4
* Email
* PDF Report generation

I wrote this application to make Clojure easier to grasp.  This is a fully functional fullstack clojure application that works and gives you a method to create a full system that includes a navigation bar with bootstrap4, session management, ability to send emails, produce PDF reports and user authentication using sessions.
This was written out of my frustration of not finding examples of a full application that actually works in clojure.  Feel free to clone this application and if you follow directions you will have a fully functional app that works and has all aspects of a full system.  Authentication, menus, database crud, reporting and emailing.
If anyone is interested you can reach me at hectorqlucero@gmail.com - concerning questions or observations concerning this software...
I hope you enjoy this code as much as I enjoyed writing it.  I love clojure and this is an effort to make clojure easier to learn and to be productive right away instead of searching in a million web pages for bits of instructions here and there...
